# Black ops 4 - Pack a punch mod

Pack a punch mod for Black Ops 4.

Someone asked me that for bo4 so I implemented it.

**Features**

- Stop the game when all the weapons were pap at least once.
- A special object can be found to buy non pap weapons, it can be disabled with the command `set apap_no_looter 0` **before the start of the game**


## How to install

Download the last version here: [ate47/bo4-pap-mod/releases][https://github.com/ate47/bo4-pap-mod/releases/].

Extract the zip file in the `project-bo4/mods` of your bo4 installation.

## Dev

Compiled with [acts](https://github.com/ate47/atian-cod-tools), trying to compile it with the t8-compiler will probably not work.
